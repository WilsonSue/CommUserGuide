# Overview of PyCharm User Documentation

## How We Worked Together

 In order to work on the same document from home, we used Git and Github to push our changes to the main branch.  
 Every time a change was made, we alerted our partner of the changes. Communication was mainly done over Discord.  
 In order to avoid conflicts, we divided the work so that only one person worked on each page.
 
## How We Made Our User Guide

 We used our experience with PyCharm from COMP 1510 to create our user guide. We chose topics that might be hard to understand for first time users of JetBrains IDEs.
 To make the guide itself, we made use of a variety of software from MkDocs to VS Code and Git.

### Using MkDocs

 The theme of our user guide was provided via [MaterialforMkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).  
 MkDocs is highly customizable with a dynamic layout.

### Using Markdown

 The pages of the user guide were written in markdown. To review markdown, we followed tutorials from [markdowntutorial.com](www.markdowntutorial.com).

### Using VS Code

 Both of us used VS Code to create each markdown file. We previewed our guide by serving it through MkDocs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our team successfully collaborated to create a comprehensive PyCharm user documentation, leveraging various tools and technologies. By utilizing Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, we were able to effectively work together remotely. Communication through Discord played a crucial role in keeping each other informed and avoiding conflicts.

Overall, the combination of efficient teamwork, effective communication, and the utilization of appropriate tools and technologies resulted in the creation of a helpful and informative PyCharm user guide that will assist beginners in navigating and understanding the features and functionalities of this powerful IDE. :joy:
