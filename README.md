# Overview of PyCharm User Documentation

## How We Worked Together

 In order to work on the same document from home, we used Git and Github to push our changes to the main branch.  
 Every time a change was made, we alerted our partner of the changes. Communication was mainly done over Discord.
 
## How We Made Our User Guide

### Using MkDocs

 The theme of our user guide was provided via [MaterialforMkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).  
 MkDocs is highly customizable with a dynamic layout.

### Using Markdown

 The pages of the user guide were written in markdown. To review markdown, we followed tutorials from [markdowntutorial.com](www.markdowntutorial.com).

### Using VS Code

 Both of us used VS Code to create each markdown file. We previewed our guide by serving it through MkDocs.
