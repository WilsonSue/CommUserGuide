# **How to add existing pycharm object**

## test

1. The first step is to navigate to the GitHub website (github.com).
2. Next is to login/signup if you don't have an account already.
3. Once you've logged in, click the "+" sign on the top right corner of the page to create a new repository.
4. Enter the title for your repository.
5. (Optionally) add a readme.md and .gitignore file.
6. In your GitHub repository, click on the "Clone or download" button and then click on "Copy to clipboard" to copy the URL of the repository.
7. The next step is to open your command line interface (CLI) on your computer.
8. Navigate your CLI path to the folder where your project is located. You can do so by selecting the folder then right clicking and selecting the copy as path option in the drop down menu.
9. Now, go back to your CLI and type cd and paste, then press enter.
10. Type "git clone" followed by a space and then paste the copied URL of the repository. Hit Enter to clone the repository to your local machine.
11. Now, open the folder containing your cloned repository in PyCharm.
12. Drag the files and folders from your project directory into the repository folder in PyCharm. This will add your project files to the Git repository.
13. Once you have added the files, go to the "Version Control" tool window in PyCharm and click on the "Commit" button.
14. In the commit dialog, write a commit message describing the changes you have made, then click "Commit and Push" to push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

### Great Job! Your existing PyCharm project is now linked to Git and all changes made in PyCharm will be tracked and pushed to your remote repository on GitHub
