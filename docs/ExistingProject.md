# **How to add Existing Pycharm Projects to GitHub :material-tab-plus:**

## Why add your project to GitHub?

In group projects, as a software developer it's quintessential to share your work with others. 

- Thus, adding your project to github allows you to share your work with others and collaborate with them. 

- Also, github allows users to revert changes, track the code history, and have multiple versions of a project.

- Lastly, it's a portfolio for your projects which can be shared to potential employers.

Now that you've seen the benefits, let's get started!
